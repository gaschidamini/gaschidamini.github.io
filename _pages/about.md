I am a PhD student in Sustainable Energy Engineering at Simon Fraser University and a member of the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/research/fas-research-labs/power-and-energy-systems/">Power & Energy Systems Research group</a><p>. Currently, I am working as an intern in a research and development (R&D) project, focusing on developing solutions to provide ancillary services through customer equipment to support distribution networks. My research primarily focuses on facilitating the electrification of transportation and heating systems. 

During my masterâ€™s degree in electrical engineering, I developed a method for assessing the reliability of power distribution systems for expansion planning as part of an R&D project funded by an electric utility.

Outside my research, you can find me taking photos with my Fuji digital camera and vintage film camera, hiking, reading cozy fiction books, and having long conversations with friends at coffee shops.
