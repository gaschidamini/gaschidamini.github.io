    The increasing integration of electric vehicles and solar photovoltaic systems may impose challenges for the operation of power distribution networks. This study assesses the impact of the integration of electric vehicles and solar photovoltaic generation on voltage issues, network loading and power losses in a low-voltage power distribution network.

    The definition of representative scenarios can be beneficial to the modelling of power distribution networks, reducing the computational burden of optimization models that require data from several power demand and photovoltaic generation profiles. We proposed a method that cluster net power demand profiles from households connected at the low-voltage distribution network. After a comprehensive study of different clustering algorithms, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm was employed to generate a dendrogram that facilitates the identification of cluster hierarchy. The results show that the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method merged clusters with lower imbalance while k-means and k-means++ clustering methods led to a high imbalance of time-series profiles within clusters.
